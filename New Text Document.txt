Both have unreal open
one of us crestes sessiom
Everyone else joins session
Do your stuff
Save your stuff
Everyone PERSISTS changes
Whoever made session goes through changelog in github, clears it out. Ignore .logs
After pushing origin to server, create pull request
Whoever did not make the session highlights everything, DISCARDS all changes 
DO NOT MERGE MULTIUSER SETTINGS
Do not merge UMap, only one person at the end of the session does it
